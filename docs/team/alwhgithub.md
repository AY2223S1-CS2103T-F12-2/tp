### Project: HackAssist

HackAssist - HackAssist is a desktop app for helping hackathon team leaders manage project tasks more easily.

It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HackAssist can get your task management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
